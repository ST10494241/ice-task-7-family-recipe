# ICE Task 7: Home-Cooked HTML – My Family Recipe

## 🍲 Recipe Title
Mozambican Peri-Peri Chicken

## 📖 Family Story / Cultural Background
This recipe comes from my grandmother, who would prepare it on special Sundays. 
Mozambican Peri-Peri Chicken is famous for its spicy sauce and unique flavor. 
In our family, it symbolizes togetherness and family celebrations.

## 📋 Ingredients
- 1 whole chicken (approx. 1.5 kg)
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 2 fresh chili peppers
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano

## 📝 Instructions
1. Clean the chicken and make small cuts so the sauce penetrates better.
2. In a blender, mix garlic, chili peppers, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, paprika, and oregano until it forms a paste.
3. Rub the paste all over the chicken, including inside.
4. Let it marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours (ideally overnight).
5. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F) and place the chicken in a baking dish.
6. Bake for 45-60 minutes, occasionally basting with the marinade.
7. Remove from oven, let rest 10 minutes, carve, and serve with rice or salad.

## 🧠 Self-Reflection

### What I Learned
I practiced HTML, CSS for layout and colors, and structuring personal content digitally. 
I also gained more insight into my family’s culinary traditions.

### Challenges I Faced
Condensing the family story and translating cooking steps into structured HTML was challenging. 
I solved it by creating clear sections and numbered lists.

### Use of AI or External Help
I used ChatGPT to translate the family recipe, optimize the CSS.

### Culture + Code
Turning a personal memory into a website showed me how technology can preserve culture and family stories.

### Future Improvements
Add original images, advanced mobile responsiveness, and maybe even video of the cooking process.
